{{< blocks/cover title="About RoverCore" image_anchor="bottom" height="min" >}}

<p class="lead mt-5">RoverCore is designed for beginner to intermediate ASP.NET core developers to learn how to develop ASP.NET SaaS applications. The project is a .NET 6 monolithic architecture that incorporates Entity Framework.  The layered approach is intended to be simple and bare-bones, allowing the developer to decide what levels of abstractions they are comfortable with implementing.
